## Task 2
>Write a program without using conditional operators that will check the a four-digit number for its symmetry. Print 0 if the number is symmetric. (A number is symmetric if it is read from left to right in the same way as from right to left)

## Task 3
>The user enters two numbers. One is assigned to one variable, and the second is assigned to another. It is necessary to change the values of the variables so that the value of the first is in the second, and the second is in the first.

## Task 4
>The electronic clock shows the time in the h:mm:ss format (from 0: 00:00 to 23:59:59), that is, the number of hours is recorded first, then a two-digit number of minutes is required, then a two-digit number of seconds is required. The number of minutes and seconds, if necessary, are supplemented to a two-digit number with zeros.
N seconds have passed since the beginning of the day. Output what the clock will show.
